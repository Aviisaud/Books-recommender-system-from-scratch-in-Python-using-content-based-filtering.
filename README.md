# How to Build a Recommendation System in Python?
Have you ever viewed a Netflix movie and had it suggest comparable ones with similar casts? Recommendation system.

Data science is widely used in marketing to create recommender systems.


Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify improve customer experience using recommendation systems. As you use the platform, these algorithms propose better content.

Spotify song recommendations are general at first. Since this music is popular, the app will suggest its most popular songs. Listening to music you like improves your recommendations. The system can even anticipate your favourite songs at different times of day.

Two years later, organisations may track data on a far greater scale. Recommendation systems can be built on millions of user data points. This way, you'll get recommendations based on your site activity and your profile is compared to others to estimate what you'll like.

To keep you as a client, Netflix will try to get you interested in other genres if you signed up for three action films.

Netflix may have suggested films outside your regular genre. The platform's recommendation system has analysed your streaming behaviour and other users' to suggest that you might like a show.

Recommendation systems can anticipate your interest in a product. Service providers and subscription platforms use this strong tactic to keep you on their site and prevent you from switching to a competitor.

Learn about recommender systems and construct one if you want to work as an analyst or marketing data scientist at Netflix, Amazon, Uber, or Spotify. Experts are needed to manage automated systems that propose products to customers in most mid- to large-sized online businesses.

I will simply discuss recommendation systems in this essay. I'll then show you how to develop a complete Python content-based recommendation engine.

## How Do Recommendation Systems Work?
Recommendation systems can be created using two techniques - content-based filtering and collaborative filtering.

### Content-Based Filtering
A content-based recommender system provides users with suggestions based on similarity in content. It is a simple method of providing recommendations based on a customerâ€™s preferences for particular content. However, the main disadvantage of this approach is that it will not be able to suggest a product that the user has never seen before. For instance, if a reader read motivation book, then the can model will never suggest that they read a romance or comedy book. This means that the user will never get a recommendation outside genres they have already interacted with.

### Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering is a technique used to generate predictions based on past user behavior. Unlike content-based recommender systems, collaborative filtering only takes customer preferences into consideration, and does not factor in the content of the item.
